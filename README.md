# Advanced Placement Computer Science
repo for AP CSP and AP CSA projects and assignments <br>
<br>
## ðŸš€ About
This is a repository for any projects and assignments done in Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) and AP CSA in my high school years. This includes my AP CSP Create Task final project, a recreation of the game Mastermind using Python. File names are typically `U# # FileName`, where `U#` is the unit number, followed by the assignment number, and then lastly followed by the name/description of the assignment. There is only one file for AP CSA, done in Java. <br>

Noteable Files:

- `AP CSA 13 Java Madlib.java` - CSA assignment for a fun madlib made in Java, a game where users fill-in-the-blank of a story with words of different parts of speeches <br> 
- `AP CSP Create Task.py` - CSP project of Mastermind made in Python for the final Create Task project <br>
- `U4 11 CryptMaster.py` - CSP project of various ciphers and encryptions made in Python that I expanded upon from the original assignment requirements <br>
